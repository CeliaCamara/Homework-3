# Homework-3

1 Distinction material: using Github
Create an online Github repository for this piece of homework, and make multiple commits while you're completing the work. Share the repository with us
(scienceanna and Riadsala) by either making us collaborators, or by making
the repository public and sending us the link. NB - you still need to submit via
FASER (see above)! [15 marks]
